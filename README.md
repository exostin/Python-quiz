# Most likely won't be continued!
I want to focus on learning C# and tbh I'm completely lost in this code which I last updated 2 years ago lol
# About
Quiz made for my "lower secondary school" project (13yr old). It has 4 functions:
1. Take the quiz (quiz.py)
2. Read scores in descending order (read.py)
3. Make your own question set (fill.py)
4. And one to rule them all! - core.py (you launch this)

# To-do:
- [x] Read questions from json file
- [x] Function for making your own question sets.
- [x] Check if this file name is possible. (These characters: / \ : * ? " > < |)
- [x] Print out questions in randomized order
- [ ] Make config.json: Questions set name; Path; Abbreviation; quiz.py will load questionsets from there, and fill.py will store them there.


_PS huge thanks to Tom Faulkner and other redditors for help!_
