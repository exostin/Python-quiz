# About
Quiz made for my school project. It has 2 functions:
1. Take the quiz (quiz.py)
2. Read scores from data.json in descending order (read.py)

PS large thanks to Tom Faulkner and other redditors for help!

# TO DO:
- Read questions from json file (opportunity to use many languages, and make this quiz 100% universal)
- Graphical Interface
