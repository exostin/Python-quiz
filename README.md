# About
Quiz made for my school project. It has 4 functions:
1. Take the quiz (quiz.py)
2. Read scores from data.json in descending order (read.py)
3. Make your own question set (fill.py)
4. And one to rule them all! - core.py (you launch this)

# To do:
- [x] Read questions from json file
- [ ] Graphical Interface
- [x] Function for making your own question sets.
- [x] Check if this file name is possible. (These characters: / \ : * ? " > < |)
- [ ] Fill function adds another option for config.json (abreviation + path)
- [ ] Print out questions in randomized order
- [ ] Make config.json. Questions set name; Path; Abbreviation. Quiz will load questionsets from there, and fill will store them there. 


PS huge thanks to Tom Faulkner and other redditors for help!
