# About
Quiz made for my school project. It has 4 functions:
1. Take the quiz (quiz.py)
2. Read scores from data.json in descending order (read.py)
3. Make your own question set (fill.py)
4. And one to rule them all! - core.py (you launch this)

# To do:
- [x] Read questions from json file
- [ ] Graphical Interface
- [x] Function for making your own question sets.
- [ ] Only possible name for file in system. (fill function) (possiblecharacters = blablabla)
- [ ] Fill function adds another option for quiz.
